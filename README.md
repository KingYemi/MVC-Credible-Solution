MVC Credible Solution

This is an MVC application that uses entity framework in the ZIP file

1: Someting happend to the dev database,so I created a sample DEMODB2 with some data for testing
2: Connectionstring should be encrypted, but since this is sample we left it unencrypted
3: I wanted to add paging, but due to time constraint I did not
4: Enable nuget restore so that the missing packages can be downloaded
